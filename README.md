# Formulating Few-shot Fine-tuning Towards Language Model Pre-training: A Pilot Study on Named Entity Recognition

### What is this?
This is the repo for the paper titled above, that designs a new task for NER few-shot fine-tuning. More details coming later.

### Code
Please check `pytorch/` for the pytorch version of the code.  The tensorflow version in `tensorflow/` is under construction.

### Dataset
`dataset/` contains some sample data for verifications. 
Check https://few-shot-ner-benchmark.github.io/ for the full datasets.
